            <h2>Destruction,“When necessary, we must be willing to take big risks, and be prepared to lose everything.”</h2>
            <p>It all begins with Bertholt, Annie and Reiner (Marcel died during the journey) infiltrating the district of Shiganshina. Bertholt's Colossal Titan smashes the gate, while Reiner's Armored Titan breaks through the inner door to invade Wall Maria and force Paradis' population behind two walls instead of three.

                <p>He is a young man that can be described as being fearless. He was dedicated to both his friends, family and people and very determined to achieve his goals of freeing the world from the Walls. Even as a child, he was always eager to want to join the Survey Corps, for the sake of escaping the Walls and exploring the outside world. This strong yearning for freedom and his dedication to his comrades were Eren's greatest strength and assets, yet it is also the reason that lead him to a darker path</p>
