                    <h2>The only thing we're allowed to believe is that we won't regret the choice we made.”. “The world is merciless, and it's also very beautiful.”. “You can't change anything unless you can discard part of yourself too.</h2>
                    <p>The story of Gundam Wing begins in the year After Colony 195 with the start of Operation Meteor, five disgruntled scientists' plan for revenge against the tyrannical OZ military organization for their oppression over the space colonies. The operation involves five young boys who have each been chosen and trained by one of the five rogue scientists, then sent to Earth independently in extremely advanced Mobile Suits, one designed by each of the scientists, known as "Gundams". Their mobile suits are called Gundams because they are constructed from a rare and astonishingly durable material known as Gundanium Alloy, which can only be created in outer space.</p>

                    <p>The five Gundam Pilots — Heero Yuy (pilot of the titular Wing Gundam), Duo Maxwell (pilot of the Deathscythe), Trowa Barton (pilot of the Heavyarms), Quatre Raberba Winner (pilot of the Sandrock), and Chang Wufei (pilot of the Shenlong) — originally have no knowledge of each others' existence. On first meeting any of the other five, each pilot believes the others to be enemy pilots in new OZ mobile suit designs. Once the young pilots realize that they have the same objective of destroying OZ (and in some cases the same mission), they band together to help each other complete their goals.</p>
